Ketty gives Eve a task to generate a report containing three columns: Name, Grade and Mark. Ketty doesn't want the NAMES of those students who received a grade lower than 8. The report must be in descending order by grade -- i.e. higher grades are entered first. If there is more than one student with the same grade (8-10) assigned to them, order those particular students by their name alphabetically. Finally, if the grade is lower than 8, use "NULL" as their name and list them by their grades in descending order. If there is more than one student with the same grade (1-7) assigned to them, order those particular students by their marks in ascending order.\
Write a query to help Eve.


```python
SELECT 
CASE
    WHEN GRADE >=8 THEN NAME
    ELSE NULL
END RNAME, GRADE, MARKS
FROM (SELECT NAME,
CASE
    WHEN MARKS >= 90 THEN 10
    WHEN MARKS >= 80 THEN 9
    WHEN MARKS >= 70 THEN 8
    WHEN MARKS >= 60 THEN 7
    WHEN MARKS >= 50 THEN 6
    WHEN MARKS >= 40 THEN 5
    WHEN MARKS >= 30 THEN 4
    WHEN MARKS >= 20 THEN 3
    WHEN MARKS >= 10 THEN 2
    WHEN MARKS >= 0 THEN 1
END GRADE,
MARKS
FROM STUDENTS) AS T
ORDER BY GRADE DESC, RNAME, MARKS
```

## 2. Top Competitors

Julia just finished conducting a coding contest, and she needs your help assembling the leaderboard! Write a query to print the respective hacker_id and name of hackers who achieved full scores for more than one challenge. Order your output in descending order by the total number of challenges in which the hacker earned a full score. If more than one hacker received full scores in same number of challenges, then sort them by ascending hacker_id.

- Hackers: The hacker_id is the id of the hacker, and name is the name of the hacker.

- Difficulty: The difficult_level is the level of difficulty of the challenge, and score is the score of the challenge for the difficulty level.

- Challenges: The challenge_id is the id of the challenge, the hacker_id is the id of the hacker who created the challenge, and difficulty_level is the level of difficulty of the challenge.

- Submissions: The submission_id is the id of the submission, hacker_id is the id of the hacker who made the submission, challenge_id is the id of the challenge that the submission belongs to, and score is the score of the submission.

```python
SELECT T.ANS_ID, T.ANS_NAME
FROM
(SELECT S.HACKER_ID AS ANS_ID, H.NAME AS ANS_NAME, COUNT(S.CHALLENGE_ID) AS C_COUNT
FROM
CHALLENGES AS C 
LEFT JOIN DIFFICULTY AS D ON C.DIFFICULTY_LEVEL = D.DIFFICULTY_LEVEL
LEFT JOIN SUBMISSIONS AS S ON C.CHALLENGE_ID = S.CHALLENGE_ID
LEFT JOIN HACKERS AS H ON S.HACKER_ID = H.HACKER_ID
WHERE D.SCORE = S.SCORE
GROUP BY S.HACKER_ID, H.NAME
ORDER BY C_COUNT DESC, S.HACKER_ID) AS T
WHERE T.C_COUNT >= 2
```
