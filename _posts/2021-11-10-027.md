## 1. Weather Observation Station 11

Query the list of CITY names from STATION that either do not start with vowels or do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

```python
SELECT DISTINCT CITY #중복 데이터는 제외하고 조회
FROM STATION
WHERE (CITY NOT REGEXP '^[aeiou]') OR (CITY NOT REGEXP '[aeiou]$') #aeiou로 시작하거나 끝나는 데이터 제외하고 조회
```

## 2. Weather Observation Station 12

Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels and do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.


```python
SELECT DISTINCT CITY #중복데이터 제거하고 조회
FROM STATION
WHERE (CITY NOT REGEXP '^[aeiou]') AND (CITY NOT REGEXP '[aeiou]$') #시작과 끝이 aeiou인 데이터 제외하고 조회
```

## 3. Higher Than 75 Marks

Query the Name of any student in STUDENTS who scored higher than  Marks. Order your output by the last three characters of each name. If two or more students both have names ending in the same last three characters (i.e.: Bobby, Robby, etc.), secondary sort them by ascending ID.

```python
SELECT NAME
FROM STUDENTS
WHERE MARKS > 75 #marks 컬럼에서 그 값이 75이상인 데이터 조회
ORDER BY RIGHT(NAME, 3), ID #name컬럼의 마지막 3자리 값을 기준으로 정렬하여 조회. 그 값이 값다면 id를 기준으로 정렬
```

## 4. Employee Names

Write a query that prints a list of employee names (i.e.: the name attribute) from the Employee table in alphabetical order.

```python
SELECT name
FROM Employee
ORDER BY name #name컬럼을 기준으로 정렬
```

## 5. Employee Salaries

Write a query that prints a list of employee names (i.e.: the name attribute) for employees in Employee having a salary greater than  per month who have been employees for less than  months. Sort your result by ascending employee_id.


```python
SELECT name
FROM Employee
WHERE months < 10 AND salary > 2000 #month 컬럼은 10보다 작고 salary 컬럼은 2000보다 큰 데이터 조회
ORDER BY employee_id # id로 정렬
```

## 6. Type of Triangle

Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

```python
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN A+B <= C THEN 'Not A Triangle' #두 변의 합이 나머지 한 변의 합보다 같거나 작으면 Not A Triangle 출력
        WHEN A=B AND B=C THEN 'Equilateral' #세 변의 길이가 같다면 Equilateral 출력
        WHEN A=B OR A=C OR B=C THEN 'Isosceles' #어느 두 변의 길이가 같다면 Isosceles 출력
        ELSE 'Scalene' #나머지는 Scalene출력
    END OUTPUT
FROM TRIANGLES
```

## 7. The PADS

Generate the following two result sets:

Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).
Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:


```python
There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.
```

where [occupation_count] is the number of occurrences of an occupation in OCCUPATIONS and [occupation] is the lowercase occupation name. If more than one Occupation has the same [occupation_count], they should be ordered alphabetically.
Note: There will be at least two entries in the table for each type of occupation.
![](https://i.esdrop.com/d/9760phgt5lnm/iZ6i0Vsj51.png)


```python
(SELECT CONCAT(N_OCC.NAME,'(',LEFT(N_OCC.OCCUPATION, 1),')') #NAME과 OCCUPATION의 첫 문자를 합하여 문자열 출력
FROM 
 (SELECT NAME, OCCUPATION
  FROM OCCUPATIONS
  ORDER BY NAME
  LIMIT 20) AS N_OCC) #OCCUPATIONS 테이블에서 NAME와 OCCUPATION를 NAME을 기준으로 정렬하여 조회

UNION ALL

(SELECT CONCAT('There are a total of ',OCC.OCC_COUNT,' ',LOWER(OCC.OCCUPATION),'s.') #결과를 concat하여 문자열 출력
FROM 
    (SELECT COUNT(OCCUPATION) AS OCC_COUNT, OCCUPATION
    FROM OCCUPATIONS
    GROUP BY OCCUPATION
    ORDER BY COUNT(OCCUPATION), OCCUPATION) AS OCC) #OCCUPATIONS 테이블에서 OCCUPATION을 카운트한 컬럼과 OCCUPATION을 
                                                    #COUNT(OCCUPATION)로 정렬하고 그 값이 같다면 OCCUPATION롤 정렬하여 조회
```
