## 1. SQL Project Planning

You are given a table, Projects, containing three columns: Task_ID, Start_Date and End_Date. It is guaranteed that the difference between the End_Date and the Start_Date is equal to 1 day for each row in the table.

If the End_Date of the tasks are consecutive, then they are part of the same project. Samantha is interested in finding the total number of different projects completed.

Write a query to output the start and end dates of projects listed by the number of days it took to complete the project in ascending order. If there is more than one project that have the same number of completion days, then order by the start date of the project.


```python
SELECT T1.START_DATE, T2.END_DATE
FROM 
(SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY A.START_DATE) AS NUM, A.START_DATE AS START_DATE
FROM PROJECTS AS A LEFT JOIN PROJECTS AS B ON A.START_DATE = B.END_DATE
WHERE B.TASK_ID IS NULL) AS T1 LEFT JOIN
(SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY A.START_DATE) AS NUM, A.END_DATE AS END_DATE
FROM PROJECTS AS A LEFT JOIN PROJECTS AS B ON A.END_DATE = B.START_DATE
WHERE B.TASK_ID IS NULL) AS T2 ON T1.NUM = T2.NUM
ORDER BY T2.END_DATE-T1.START_DATE
```

## 2. Placements

You are given three tables: Students, Friends and Packages. Students contains two columns: ID and Name. Friends contains two columns: ID and Friend_ID (ID of the ONLY best friend). Packages contains two columns: ID and Salary (offered salary in $ thousands per month).

Write a query to output the names of those students whose best friends got offered a higher salary than them. Names must be ordered by the salary amount offered to the best friends. It is guaranteed that no two students got same salary offer.


```python
SELECT T.MYNAME
FROM
(SELECT F.ID AS MYID, S.NAME AS MYNAME, P.SALARY AS MYSAL, F.FRIEND_ID AS FID
FROM
FRIENDS AS F LEFT JOIN STUDENTS AS S ON F.ID = S.ID
LEFT JOIN PACKAGES AS P ON F.ID = P.ID) AS T
LEFT JOIN PACKAGES AS P ON T.FID = P.ID
WHERE T.MYSAL < P.SALARY
ORDER BY P.SALARY
```

## 3. Symmetric Pairs

You are given a table, Functions, containing two columns: X and Y.

![](https://i.esdrop.com/d/9760phgt5lnm/RafZjAKwpj.png)

Two pairs (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are said to be symmetric pairs if X1 = Y2 and X2 = Y1.

Write a query to output all such symmetric pairs in ascending order by the value of X. List the rows such that X1 ≤ Y1.


```python
SELECT A.X, A.Y
FROM FUNCTIONS AS A INNER JOIN FUNCTIONS AS B ON A.Y = B.X AND A.X = B.Y
GROUP BY A.X, A.Y
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2 OR A.X < A.Y
ORDER BY A.X
```
