## 1. Ollivander's Inventory

Harry Potter and his friends are at Ollivander's with Ron, finally replacing Charlie's old broken wand.

Hermione decides the best way to choose is by determining the minimum number of gold galleons needed to buy each non-evil wand of high power and age. Write a query to print the id, age, coins_needed, and power of the wands that Ron's interested in, sorted in order of descending power. If more than one wand has same power, sort the result in order of descending age.

- Wands: The id is the id of the wand, code is the code of the wand, coins_needed is the total number of gold galleons needed to buy the wand, and power denotes the quality of the wand (the higher the power, the better the wand is).

- Wands_Property: The code is the code of the wand, age is the age of the wand, and is_evil denotes whether the wand is good for the dark arts. If the value of is_evil is 0, it means that the wand is not evil.

```python
SELECT T2.ID, T1.WAGE, T1.MCOIN, T1.WPOWER
FROM
(SELECT WANDS_PROPERTY.AGE AS WAGE, 
 MIN(WANDS.COINS_NEEDED) AS MCOIN, 
 WANDS.POWER AS WPOWER
FROM WANDS LEFT JOIN WANDS_PROPERTY ON WANDS.CODE = WANDS_PROPERTY.CODE
WHERE WANDS_PROPERTY.IS_EVIL = 0
GROUP BY WANDS_PROPERTY.AGE, WANDS.POWER) AS T1,
(SELECT WANDS.ID AS ID, 
 WANDS.POWER AS POWER, 
 WANDS.COINS_NEEDED AS COIN,
 WANDS_PROPERTY.AGE AS AGE
FROM WANDS LEFT JOIN WANDS_PROPERTY ON WANDS.CODE = WANDS_PROPERTY.CODE) AS T2
WHERE T1.WAGE = T2.AGE AND T1.MCOIN = T2.COIN AND T1.WPOWER = T2.POWER
ORDER BY T1.WPOWER DESC, T1.WAGE DESC
```

## 2. Challenges

Julia asked her students to create some coding challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and the total number of challenges created by each student. Sort your results by the total number of challenges in descending order. If more than one student created the same number of challenges, then sort the result by hacker_id. If more than one student created the same number of challenges and the count is less than the maximum number of challenges created, then exclude those students from the result.

- Hackers: The hacker_id is the id of the hacker, and name is the name of the hacker.

- Challenges: The challenge_id is the id of the challenge, and hacker_id is the id of the student who created the challenge.

```python
SELECT H.HACKER_ID, H.NAME, COUNT(C.CHALLENGE_ID) AS CNT
FROM HACKERS AS H LEFT JOIN CHALLENGES AS C ON H.HACKER_ID=C.HACKER_ID
GROUP BY H.HACKER_ID, H.NAME
ORDER BY CNT DESC, H.HACKER_ID

## 3. Contest Leaderboard

You did such a great job helping Julia with her last coding contest challenge that she wants you to work on this one, too!

The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and total score of the hackers ordered by the descending score. If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, then sort the result by ascending hacker_id. Exclude all hackers with a total score of  from your result.

- Hackers: The hacker_id is the id of the hacker, and name is the name of the hacker.

- Submissions: The submission_id is the id of the submission, hacker_id is the id of the hacker who made the submission, challenge_id is the id of the challenge for which the submission belongs to, and score is the score of the submission.

```python
SELECT T.HID, T.HNAME, SUM(T.MSCORE)
FROM (SELECT H.HACKER_ID AS HID, 
H.NAME AS HNAME, 
S.CHALLENGE_ID AS CID, 
MAX(S.SCORE) AS MSCORE
FROM SUBMISSIONS AS S LEFT JOIN HACKERS AS H ON S.HACKER_ID=H.HACKER_ID
GROUP BY H.HACKER_ID, H.NAME, S.CHALLENGE_ID) AS T
GROUP BY T.HID, T.HNAME
HAVING SUM(T.MSCORE) > 0
ORDER BY SUM(T.MSCORE) DESC, T.HID
```
