## 1. Occupations

Pivot the Occupation column in OCCUPATIONS so that each Name is sorted alphabetically and displayed underneath its corresponding Occupation. The output column headers should be Doctor, Professor, Singer, and Actor, respectively.

Note: Print NULL when there are no more names corresponding to an occupation.

```python
#모르겠음...
SET @D=0, @P=0, @S=0, @A=0; 
SELECT MIN(Doctor), MIN(Professor), MIN(Singer), MIN(Actor) 
FROM 
(SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Doctor' THEN @D := @D+1 
        WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Professor' THEN @P := @P+1 
        WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Singer' THEN @S := @S+1 
        WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Actor' THEN @A := @A+1 
    END AS ROWNUMBER , 
    CASE 
        WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Doctor' THEN NAME 
    END AS Doctor , 
    CASE 
        WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Professor' THEN NAME 
    END AS Professor , 
    CASE
        WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Singer' THEN NAME 
    END AS Singer , 
    CASE 
        WHEN OCCUPATION = 'Actor' THEN NAME 
    END AS Actor 
 FROM OCCUPATIONS ORDER BY NAME) AS TEMP
 GROUP BY ROWNUMBER

## 2. Binary Tree Nodes

You are given a table, BST, containing two columns: N and P, where N represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and P is the parent of N.
![](https://i.esdrop.com/d/9760phgt5lnm/qjQwh8HQlr.png)

Write a query to find the node type of Binary Tree ordered by the value of the node. Output one of the following for each node:

- Root: If node is root node.
- Leaf: If node is leaf node.
- Inner: If node is neither root nor leaf node.


```python
SELECT N,
    CASE 
        WHEN P IS NULL THEN 'Root' #p값이 null이면 root
        WHEN N IN (SELECT DISTINCT P FROM BST) THEN 'Inner' #n값이 P에 있다면 inner
        ELSE 'Leaf' #그 외에는 leaf
    END OUTPUT
FROM BST
ORDER BY N #n컬럼을 기준으로 정렬
```

## 3. New Companies

Amber's conglomerate corporation just acquired some new companies. Each of the companies follows this hierarchy:\
![](https://i.esdrop.com/d/9760phgt5lnm/mdu6VPkoYy.png)\
Given the table schemas below, write a query to print the company_code, founder name, total number of lead managers, total number of senior managers, total number of managers, and total number of employees. Order your output by ascending company_code.

Note:

- The tables may contain duplicate records.
- The company_code is string, so the sorting should not be numeric. For example, if the company_codes are C_1, C_2, and C_10, then the ascending company_codes will be C_1, C_10, and C_2.

**Input Format**
The following tables contain company data:

- Company: The company_code is the code of the company and founder is the founder of the company.\

- Lead_Manager: The lead_manager_code is the code of the lead manager, and the company_code is the code of the working company. \
![](https://i.esdrop.com/d/9760phgt5lnm/cggf5wV00i.png)

- Senior_Manager: The senior_manager_code is the code of the senior manager, the lead_manager_code is the code of its lead manager, and the company_code is the code of the working company.\
![](https://i.esdrop.com/d/9760phgt5lnm/Yb1OtZPbwK.png)

- Manager: The manager_code is the code of the manager, the senior_manager_code is the code of its senior manager, the lead_manager_code is the code of its lead manager, and the company_code is the code of the working company.\
![](https://i.esdrop.com/d/9760phgt5lnm/v4927d1Yo6.png)

- Employee: The employee_code is the code of the employee, the manager_code is the code of its manager, the senior_manager_code is the code of its senior manager, the lead_manager_code is the code of its lead manager, and the company_code is the code of the working company. \

```python
SELECT COMPANY_CODE, FOUNDER, LM, SM, MN, EM
FROM COMPANY
LEFT OUTER JOIN
(SELECT COMPANY_CODE AS CC, COUNT(DISTINCT LEAD_MANAGER_CODE) AS LM,
COUNT(DISTINCT SENIOR_MANAGER_CODE) AS SM, COUNT(DISTINCT MANAGER_CODE) AS MN, 
COUNT(DISTINCT EMPLOYEE_CODE) AS EM
FROM EMPLOYEE
GROUP BY COMPANY_CODE) AS T #T테이블 : employee테이블에서 COMPANY_CODE로 그룹화하여 각 직책별 인원수를 가져옴
ON COMPANY.COMPANY_CODE = T.CC #company테이블과 T테이블을 COMPANY_CODE를 기준으로 join
ORDER BY COMPANY_CODE #COMPANY_CODE를 기준으로 정렬
```
